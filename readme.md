NumEd - The Numerical Editor
----------------------------
The main purpose of this editor is to provide a way to edit text only with the
numerical keyboard. It may sound silly, but it allows you to interact with text
using only one hand. Also, it is fun!

Features:
---------
- none

Current development:
--------------------
- Getting ncurses to display text.

Bugs:
-----
- none

Future ideas:
-------------
- ncurses for display
- Normal and input mode as in vim. / = Esc
- T9 standart for text input
